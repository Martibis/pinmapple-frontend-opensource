### Requirements to run

- Google Maps API key -> add it to index.php (for more info: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
- Set up database (SQL script can be found at https://github.com/Martibis/pinmapple-backend-opensource)
- Update PHP/connection.php with your database values

### Noteworthy

The frontend has some backend functionality mixed in (which still need to be moved to the NodeJS backend at some point). With this in mind if you want to run this locally you'll need a tool like XAMPP to be able to run the PHP files.
